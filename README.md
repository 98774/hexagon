\*\* I designed this project as part of an ongoing process to teach myself computer graphics using OpenGL and GLFW. It is not a full clone but was useful for teaching me about handling objects and verices in OpenGL

This repository contains a clone of the popular minimalist action game, Super Hexagon. The game challenges players with fast-paced, geometric dodging, testing reflexes and spatial awareness.

## About the Game

Super Hexagon Clone aims to replicate the core gameplay experience of the original. You control a small triangle at the center of the screen, rotating to navigate through an ever-closing series of walls. The objective is to survive as long as possible as the game's speed and complexity increase.

## Features

Fast-paced, minimalist gameplay: Experience the intense, reflex-driven action.
Geometric visuals: Navigate through an abstract world of rotating shapes.
Increasing difficulty: The challenge escalates as you progress, with faster speeds and more complex patterns.

## How to Play

Control your triangle: You'll use left and right arrow keys (or 'A' and 'D') to rotate your triangle clockwise or counter-clockwise.
